Hello!

🖐🏾 My name is Zuri and I'm a self-taught coder.

C++ is my strongest language and I'm slowly dabbling into new ones.

Interests:
- Android Reverse Engineering. Find myself playing around with Frida, Objective and JADX a lot.
- Networking. I am currently learning the ropes of networking/cybersecurity with TryHackMe.

Current project: Building a simple messaging program from scratch with C++.
